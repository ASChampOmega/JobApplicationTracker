# JobApplicationTracker
This is the code for a website that job-seekers can use to track their job applications, and gain analytics based on the companies they have applied to. (No running website at present).

The full website code is not up yet. The code here is the code that has been tested properly from Node.js and React.
I have also not added the JSON files, script files, and libraries that tie this together. My goal of this GitHub was to show my skills, that I do know React and Node.js, however, I have not found a good platform to host the site yet, since Heroku has become paid :(, especially since I do have some local SQL databases that need to be accessed as well.

If I cannot find a site, I'll probably upload more code here, otherwise, I'll directly be hosting the full site.
