# JobApplicationTracker
This is the code for a website that job-seekers can use to track their job applications, and gain analytics based on the companies they have applied to. (No running website at present).

The full website code is not up yet. The code here is the code that has been tested properly from Node.js and React.
I have not found a good platform to host the site yet, since Heroku has become paid :(

If I cannot find a site, I'll probably upload more code here, otherwise, I'll directly be hosting the full site.
